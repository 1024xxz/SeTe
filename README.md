The file data.xlsx contains the raw data and the files RF_Pyrite_Classifier.pkl and SVM_Pyrite_Classifier.pkl contain the classification models built using two different classification methods.
It is recommended to convert the raw data to .csv format and run "Se-Te bearing deposits.ipynb" to copy the classifiers. 
Run "app2.py" to make new predictions using the classifier. 
Python environment along with pandas and scikit-learn libraries are required.
